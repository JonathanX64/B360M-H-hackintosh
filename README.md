## Backstory of this build
I had an iMac 5K (Late 2015) in top-of-the-line-but-not-custom configuration: i5-6600, 16 GB DDR3-1866, Radeon R9 M395 2 GB, 2TB Fusion Drive (128 GB flash & 2 TB HDD).

It ran slower than I expected and had some annoying problems. To fix the machine, I had to disassemble it, replace noisy cooling system, replace hard drive, replace flash storage, and add more memory. Or just sell it and get a newer one (Apple's way of fixing thingsâ„¢).

Above-mentioned upgrades are expensive. New Apple 256 GB Gen. 5B SSD have insane prices, and 4x8 or 2x16 sticks of DDR3-1866 are impossible to source these days. Plus, I had to pay for disassembly and reassembly of this computer (or risk breaking the display). 

So I've sold it... but built a Hackintosh instead! I was aiming at 2x performance for 0.5x of second-hand market price of this iMac, and I think I got it. Excited!
